Overview
========
The IAP EEPROM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK IAP
driver. It writes and reads the EEPROM page. A message a printed on the UART terminal
as EEPROM read and write operations are performed.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso54608 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the LPC-Link USB port (J8) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.

Running the demo
================
1.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

The following lines are printed to the serial terminal when the demo program is executed.
