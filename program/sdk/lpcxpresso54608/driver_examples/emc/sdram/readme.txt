Overview
========

The emc_sdram example shows how to access the SDRAM.

In this example, user shall initialize the EMC (external memory controller), initialize the
EMC dynamic memory controller before access the external SDRAM.

If the sdram example fails, please make sure to check the following points:
1. Please take refer to the board.readme to check the jumper settings on your board.
2. Please take refer to the EMC chapter in API RM to do the delay calibration to found the best delay for your board, then update the delay to the EMC clock delay control registers in the system configure module registers.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCLPCXpresso54608 board

Board settings
==============
a)  JP8 must be set on 3-5, 9-11

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the LPC-Link USB port (J8) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.

Running the demo
================
1.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
